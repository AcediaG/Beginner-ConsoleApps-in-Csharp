/* This piece of code is the known game Rock, Paper, Scissors made with C#. Playing vs the cpu which generates a random decision to battle against you.
As usual the game is best of 5, so the first player to reach the score of 3 wins the game and a win counter is updated.
After that, the number of win counter is shown and the user is prompted to play again.
If he decides to play again the score counter resets to zero and the game starts over.
If not then the number of wins of each player is shown as a final score and the press of a key is needed to close the application.
Comments beside each line of code will explain the use of it. */
